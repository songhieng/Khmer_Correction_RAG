Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) becomes a strong candidate for your OCR-name-matching problem because it marries the precision of a curated database with the flexibility of a generative model. Here’s why it works:

1. **Grounding in a Known Database**
   – **Deterministic accuracy**: Every output must come from your indexed “truth” list of Khmer–Roman pairs—no more hallucinations or invented names.
   – **Exhaustive coverage**: As long as your database includes the target name, retrieval ensures it’s on the shortlist.

2. **Robustness to OCR Noise**
   – **Vector/semantic similarity**: Instead of exact string matching (which breaks on even one mis-recognized character), a dense retriever maps both the noisy OCR text and each true name into embedding space. Close matches rise to the top despite insertions, deletions, or substitutions in the OCR output.
   – **Keyword fall-back**: You can blend sparse (keyword) retrieval to catch partial overlaps—e.g. “សុំះា” still retrieves “សុខា (Sokha).”

3. **Generative Disambiguation**
   – **Context-aware ranking**: The LLM can look at the top-k retrieved candidates and, using any document context (other fields on your ID card), pick or re-rank the best fit.
   – **Flexible formatting**: It can output the final match in exactly the form you need—Khmer script + Roman transliteration.

4. **Scalability & Automation**
   – **Batch processing**: You can loop over thousands of OCR outputs, retrieving and generating in chunks, without manual intervention.
   – **Incremental updates**: When you add new names or correct transliterations, you simply re-index—no changes to model weights.

5. **Reduced Maintenance Overhead**
   – **No custom tuning**: You don’t have to hand-craft fuzzy-matching thresholds or write elaborate regex rules for every common OCR glitch.
   – **Prompt-driven tweaks**: Improving behavior often only requires adjusting the generation prompt (“From these candidates, choose the most similar name to the input.”), not retraining.

### Why RAG vs. Traditional Fuzzy Matching?

| Aspect                 | Fuzzy Matching                     | RAG                           |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Error tolerance**    | Character-level only (Levenshtein) | Semantic + character-level    |
| **Scalability**        | O(N) comparisons per query         | Sub-linear via vector index   |
| **Hallucination risk** | Zero (but misses unseen variants)  | Zero (only returns indexed)   |
| **Context use**        | None                               | LLM can leverage extra fields |
| **Maintenance**        | Tuning thresholds, custom rules    | Prompt tweaks, re-indexing    |

Because RAG combines the best of both worlds—a reliable lookup against your master list and intelligent, context-aware selection—you end up with a system that can correct noisy OCR outputs into valid Khmer names with far higher accuracy and far less manual effort than pure fuzzy matching or vanilla LLM completion.
